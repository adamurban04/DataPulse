Introduction

Each year, an estimated 42,000 people in Ireland are diagnosed with cancer, including both 
invasive and non-invasive tumors [3]. Recent research indicates over 24,000 invasive cases 
annually, with 13,075 in men and 11,349 in women were reported during 2019-2021 [1, 3], among 
which lung cancer was the third most common cancer in males and the second most common in 
females [3].

Lung cancer, in particular, is the most deadly in Ireland, making it the leading cause of cancer
fatalities for both sexes [3]. The future presents an even more alarming picture, with 
projections indicating a rapid increase in lung cancer incidence, especially among women, with 
rates expected to rise by 105% between 2015 and 2045, by 131% in men, and by 119% combined [2].

In light of these statistics, our research focuses on Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most 
prevalent type of primary lung cancer within the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) category 
[4]. This choice is informed by the dataset’s popularity and distinctive characteristics.

Our goal is to offer meaningful contributions to the global effort against lung cancer, 
enhancing our collective understanding and potentially leading to more effective treatment 
strategies.
